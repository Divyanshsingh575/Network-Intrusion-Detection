Background
With the increasing reliance on computer networks for communication and data exchange, ensuring the security of these networks is paramount. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a crucial component of network security, responsible for monitoring network traffic and identifying suspicious activities or potential security breaches. The goal of an IDS is to detect and respond to unauthorized access or malicious activities in real-time, thereby safeguarding the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data and resources within the network.

Problem Statement
Develop an effective and reliable intrusion detection system (IDS) capable of accurately identifying and alerting on anomalous network behavior indicative of unauthorized access, malicious activities, or potential security threats. The IDS should be able to analyze network traffic data in real-time or near real-time, leveraging machine learning and/or statistical techniques to differentiate between normal and abnormal network behavior. Additionally, the IDS should provide timely alerts and actionable insights to network administrators or security personnel, enabling prompt response and mitigation of security incidents.

Objectives
Data Collection: Gather a diverse and representative dataset of network traffic data, including both normal and anomalous activities.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure consistency, remove noise, and extract relevant features for analysis.
Model Development: Develop machine learning models or statistical algorithms capable of accurately detecting intrusions and classifying network traffic as normal or malicious.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the IDS models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Real-time Analysis: Implement the IDS system to analyze network traffic data in real-time or near real-time, ensuring timely detection and response to security threats.
Alerting Mechanism: Design an alerting mechanism to notify network administrators or security personnel of detected intrusions or suspicious activities, providing actionable insights for mitigation.
Scalability and Efficiency: Ensure that the IDS is scalable and efficient, capable of handling large volumes of network traffic data without compromising performance or accuracy.
Deliverables
Technical Report: Document the entire process, including data collection, preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and implementation of the IDS system.
Codebase: Provide well-organized and documented codebase containing scripts, modules, and configuration files necessary for reproducing the results and deploying the IDS system.
Demo/Prototype: Optionally, develop a demo or prototype of the IDS system showcasing its functionality and capabilities in detecting and responding to network intrusions.
